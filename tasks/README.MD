## Tasks

These are tasks you can perform to prepare for the exam.

The only task that is absolutely necessary to have a working cluster is `1-deploy-kubernetes.md`. This has been modified for this lab to get you to a working state as quickly as possible. Additional tasks which are almost certainly not on the exam are included as well. These are to extend the functionality of the cluster to allow for the use of external loadbalancer services and persistent volumes.
