## Additional Docs & Tools

Some additional documents found online that maybe useful in your studies are included in this folder.

Of particular value is the bookmarks.html file. This can be imported into your browser and used on the exam to quickly get to various resources. It is updated as of version 1.18 and should be sorted manually after importing to be most effective. Each link is formated to quickly find information (generally like so: `<group>-<link description>`)

The cka-prep-list.html is a copy of a great resource I found online [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mYzfkxu1Iaup3KgO7zhbz7C4nFadSEvogo-lDaFIXK0/edit#gid=254552495). The bookmarks file comes from this spreadsheet actually.
